      <title>Composite Materials - Game Changers</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-composite-materials&#34;&gt;What are composite materials?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composite materials are in essence a combination of at least two materials with different chemical properties that only mix on a macroscopic level.
The individual components remain physically distinct, the resulting composite structure behaves as one.
In this manner composite materials are designed to leverage the ‘best’ parts of the individual constituents and combine them into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf&#34;&gt;new composite material&lt;/a&gt; with superior properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All things spinal. Anatomy as a living language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden behind a somewhat generic title, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030209247&#34;&gt;Spinal Anatomy, Modern Concepts&lt;/a&gt;,” we discover pearls for anyone
interested in the spine. It is edited by &lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.eccelearning.com/faculty/dr-jean-marc-vital&#34;&gt;Prof. Jean Marc Vital&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Derek-Cawley&#34;&gt;Dr. Derek Thomas Cawley&lt;/a&gt;, both from the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chu-bordeaux.fr&#34;&gt;University of Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, with its long established tradition that combines the study of spine surgery,
anatomy and physiology. In Bordeaux, these subjects seem inseparable and must be continuously renewed.
Vibrantly written, magnificently illustrated, to plunge inside is to find what chapter authors, &lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.eccelearning.com/faculty/prof-alain-dimeglio&#34;&gt;Dimeglio&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780429352416-7/normal-abnormal-development-growth-spine-thoracic-cage-federico-canavese-fran%C3%A7ois-bonnel-alain-dimeglio&#34;&gt;Bonnel&lt;/a&gt;
call, anatomy as a “living language” and to explore its “inexhaustible fecundity.” That is, the spine’s
incessant capacity to adapt and transform. The authors remind us that anatomy, as a story, has been told
“since the origin of humans.” And yet still, from each generation’s technology and prospective, it must be
told again and again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Next generation flexStaas pedicle screw system receives 510(k) clearance</title>
      <link>https://spinenuances.com/blog/gii_flexstaas_pedicle_screw_fda_clearance/</link>

      <guid>https://spinenuances.com/blog/gii_flexstaas_pedicle_screw_fda_clearance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spinenuances.com/&#34;&gt;Spine Nuances&lt;/a&gt; is excited to announce that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spinenuances.com/products/GII_pedicle_fixation&#34;&gt;GII pedicle fixation&lt;/a&gt; system now includes
the next generation flexStaas pedicle screw that was recently cleared by the FDA for the US market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flexStaas pedicle screw as part of the Coligne GII spinal fixation system is intended to provide immobilization and stabilization of spinal segments in skeletally mature patients as an adjunct to fusion.
The poly-axial flexStaas pedicle screw features (1) a tulip design with a large docking surface and click grip for a fast and strong connection,
(2) double helix cancellous thread with a self-tapping tip for fast and precise screw placement and (3) an increased resistance to torque.
The set screw has (1) a wide self-aligning thread that facilitates set screw positioning and tightening and
(2) a torx interface to increase axial compression for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html&#34;&gt;Coligne&lt;/a&gt; Titanium rods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ostaPek® carbon composite - Biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://spinenuances.com/blog/ostapek_carbon_composite_part_two_biomechanics/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ostaPek® is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html&#34;&gt;Coligne&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; proprietary &lt;a href=&#34;https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf&#34;&gt;carbon composite material&lt;/a&gt; for spine fusion indications.
It comprises 67% long, continuous carbon fibers embedded in a 33% PEKEKK matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to state-of-the-art materials for spinal fusion, such as metals or PEEK, ostaPek® carbon composite has potential advantages in
at least three areas playing a major role in spine fusion: &lt;a href=&#34;https://spinenuances.com/blog/ostapek_carbon_composite_part_one_biology&#34;&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, biomechanics, and response to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ever wonder what fusion with ostaPek® implants looks like?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jacky, a male Rottweiler age 11, suffered from tetraplegia that also restricted his mobility at the cervical spine and was associated with pain.
MRI found a disc-protrusion with dynamic compression of the spinal cord at the C6-7 level.
He was diagnosed with chronic progressive Caudal Cervical Spondylomyelopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pre-op images illustrate the case of a polytraumatized 19-year-old woman involved in a motor vehicle accident, diagnosed with a one-level (C7) burst fracture. The backward movement of the posterior wall of C7 lead to a decrease in muscular tonus in the upper limbs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://spinenuances.com/blog/ostapek_carbon_composite_part_one_biology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ostaPek® is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf&#34;&gt;carbon composite material&lt;/a&gt; developed and made by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html&#34;&gt;Coligne&lt;/a&gt;
for spine fusion applications, since 1994. It is made of 67% long oriented carbon fibers embedded in a 33% PEKEKK matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking of potential advantages of ostaPek® carbon composite compared to state-of-the-art materials for spinal fusion, such as PEEK or metals,
there are at least 3 major fields where ostaPek® can have an impact: biology, biomechanics, and response to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Instruments in the Surgeon&#39;s Hands</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spine fusion surgery is a hands-on craft and art. From a design point of view, the observation of the surgeons’ gestures
is most helpful as we see how objects are held and what they represent to the surgeon, the nurse, and the operative staff.
They point, hold, review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>ostaPek® spine cages are designed to maximise space for bone graft without compromising mechanical strength.
This is possible by engineering specific fiber patterns that follow the direction of the longitudinal forces similar to the trabeculae in the adjacent vertebral bodies.</description>

      <description>ostaPek® vertebral body replacement cages.
The ostaPek® VBR system consists of one or multiple stackable cages to be used in the thoracolumbar spine for tumor or trauma. It is designed for strength for primary stabilization and radiolucency for radiological follow-up at the treated level. An artificial pedicle provides a connection between cage construct and posterior fixation for a complete reconstruction of the spinal column.</description>

      <description>ostaPek® extraforaminal &amp;amp; transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion cages.
The ostaPek® Erriva™ 3 cage is the latest design of the Coligne transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion cages. Gentle bulleting and tapering of the ostaPek® Erriva™ 3 cage combined with ventral placement allows sagittal correction after implantation through a small, foraminal annulotomy. A specifically engineered interface with the cage inserter provides strength and control during implantation.</description>

      <description>The ostaPek® carbon composite material is radiolucent and therefore allows for clear post-operative radiological visual assessment and treatment.
67% of the ostaPek® carbon composite material are long, oriented carbon fibers embedded in a 33% PEKEKK matrix.
PEKEKK has a noticeably higher strength level and overall stability compared to PEEK.</description>
