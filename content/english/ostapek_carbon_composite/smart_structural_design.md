[ostaPek®](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) spine cages are designed to maximise space for bone graft without compromising mechanical strength. 

This is possible by engineering specific fiber patterns that follow the direction of the longitudinal forces similar to the trabeculae in the adjacent vertebral bodies.
