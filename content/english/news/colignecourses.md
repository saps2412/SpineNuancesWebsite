Since 1994, the strength of Coligne has been not only in the development of implants and instruments, but also in the international courses and discussion sessions that are organized yearly.

Four types of experiences have been proposed though the years:

### Spine surgeons workshop
Hands-on sessions on sawbones or in an anatomy lab, to explore ostaPek® carbon composite nuances or a new surgical approach. 
Teachers and students flip role often during the same session. Participation and exchange.  

### Developer sessions
Every surgeon, nurse, sales assistant and technical person knows how to improve a system. 
But development is possible only via sustainable steps that really bring value. Discussions, sketches, case presentations are the starting point for change.

### Host and guests tours
Some gestures, details, adjustments can only be learned by observing a colleague performing surgery, in a private and “protected” occasion. 
Change of settings and a different perspective on a patient always bring ideas.

### Live surgeries
In a few dense days, hosts and guests join for a spectrum of ostaPek® surgical treatments. Guests become part of the case work up. 
They observe their hosts performing surgery and participate in the post-op briefing.
