## Spine Nuances LLC, USA

Spine Nuances is the brainchild of a long-standing Coligne development engineer. Based on the outstanding performance of ostaPek® cages and plates during the past 30 years in Europe, 
Spine Nuances focus is to establish the ostaPek® material as well as all [Coligne](http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html) products in the North American market as one of the leading brands 
for spine fusion. 

As Coligne's distribution arm for the North American market Spine Nuances is a complement to the Coligne business headquartered in Europe. 
We work with surgeons directly as well as agents and distributors. 

## Coligne AG, Switzerland

[Coligne](http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html) was founded in Switerland in 1993 based on the founders, Robert Lange, desire to provide surgeons and their patients with improved methods and materials for spine surgery. 

Driven by this pioneering spirit Coligne has focused on exploring the details of both surgical technique and the development of a new bio-material, ostaPek® carbon composite. 
Long lasting relationships with clients based on trust and respect have allowed Coligne to establish itself as one of the technology leaders for 
spine fusion in Europe today both in terms of surgical technique as well as implant material. 

<!-- [Coligne](http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html) maintains its new way of thinking and strategy that biomaterials are required to build higher performance implant systems for more complete surgery, yet with less trauma to the patient. 
Working closely with the spine community and introducing broad expertise into a functioning group, Coligne spine implant systems continue to be made simpler to employ, yet more effective in treatment.  -->
Coligne maintains its new way of thinking by encouraging exchange between different generations and professionals coming from various fields.
Know-how grows. Treatment technology continuously improves. This is the “Coligne strategy in spine”.

Coligne headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland, with a distribution and education office in Paris, France and a biomaterial lab in Boulder Colorado USA.
