## SpineNuances LLC, USA

SpineNuances is the brainchild of a long-standing Coligne development engineer. Based on the outstanding performance of ostaPek® cages and plates during the past 30 years in Europe, 
SpineNuances focus is to establish the ostaPek® material as well as all Coligne products in the North American market as one of the leading brands 
for spine fusion. 

As Coligne's distribution arm for the North American market SpineNuances is a complement to the Coligne business headquartered in Europe. We work with surgeons directly as well as agents and distributors. 

## Coligne AG, Switzerland

Coligne was founded in Switerland in 1993 based on the founders', Robert Lange, desire to provide surgeons and their patients with improved methods and materials for spine surgery. 

Driven by this pioneering spirit Coligne has focused on the development of both surgical technique, implants including bio-material development and easy-to-use instrumentation ever since. 
Long lasting relationships with clients based on trust and respect have allowed Coligne to establish itself as one of the technology leaders for 
spine fusion in Europe today both in terms of surgical technique as well as implant material. 

Coligne maintains its new way of thinking and strategy that biomaterials are required to build higher performance implant systems for more complete surgery, yet with less trauma to the patient. 
Working closely with the spine community and introducing broad expertise into a functioning group, Coligne spine implant systems continue to be made simpler to employ, yet more effective in treatment. 
Know-how grows. Treatment technology continuously improves. This is the “Coligne strategy in spine”.

Coligne headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland, with a development office in Paris, France and a biomaterial lab in Boulder Colorado USA.
