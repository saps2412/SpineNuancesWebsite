## The optimal use of tools. An experience.

Performed with instruments, spinal surgery remains a hands-on
art.

A surgery is presented and its sequence defined. The instructors
at each station have the most experience. At table one,
he is 60. Mean age of the students, perhaps 45. At table two,
she is 43, but most of the “students” are over 60. In one
hour, this will reverse. The surgeon who was a novice in the
previous technique, but with a 2'000 case experience in next
teaching session, will show the others in practice what has
been learned over 30 years. There is frank discussion and the
confidence that comes with joining others in action. Exploration
as a team. No one leaves unchanged.

Open to surgeons and health care
professionals working with Coligne products and technology.
