## Observation close up.

With the help of our larger hospital customers, Live Surgeries
are now organized in response to the demand for more teaching.
Attendees spend two and one half days in a facility were
a number Coligne product cases are organized for close up
observation. You'll see and work with experienced colleagues
while they perform several different Coligne surgeries, or
several cases of the same technique. Hands-on workshop
and scientific meetings are part of the event.

Contact us for scheduled dates.
