Some gestures, details, adjustments can only be learned by observing a colleague performing surgery, in a private and protected occasion. 
Change of settings and a different perspective on a patient always bring ideas.

## Continuity in the initiative process.

Every surgeon and health care professional can recall when,
where and with whom they learned a fundamental precept in
their field. It follows them through life.

If surgical knowledge can be found in books, its performance
is learned with another. This can be a teacher from the past,
the creator of a technique, someone experienced in a method
that is new to the guest.

Designed on the premise that learning for surgery must be
life long, Host & Guest Surgeries are organized to create a
more in depth experience of a method and person on site.
This can range from a custom mini-fellowship to a one-day
program to see a surgical procedure. It is a way to expand
your understanding and methods. Sometimes it starts a lasting
friendship.
