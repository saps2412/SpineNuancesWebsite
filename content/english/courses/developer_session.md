Every surgeon, nurse, sales assistant and technical person knows how to improve a system. 
But development is possible only via sustainable steps that really bring value. Discussions, sketches, case presentations are the starting point for change.

<!--more-->

## Evaluation, debate, renewal.

With every improvement in surgical strategy, each small
progress in product or technique, there is another question to
explore. The Developer Sessions are shared experience that
can be defined by their diversity of method, frank discussion
and respect for the ideas of someone else. It is not a place to
seek a perfect consensus, because in spinal surgery, there
are few.

A theme is selected. Cases and different methods presented.
Questions are asked, principles and findings discussed. New
paths are found, new directions to explore.

Open to surgeons and health care
professionals working with Coligne products and technology.
