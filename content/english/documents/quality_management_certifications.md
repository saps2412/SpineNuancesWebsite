### ISO 13485 - MDSAP 

[ISO 13485:2016 MDSAP](https://saps2412.github.io/quality_system/Certificate_MDSAP_Canada_USA.pdf) -- Coligne quality management system certification under 
[MDSAP](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/cdrh-international-programs/medical-device-single-audit-program-mdsap) (Medical Device Single Audit Program) for the USA (21 CFR 820) and Canada (SOR/98-282).

Assessment of a company’s quality system under the MDSAP program leverages the ISO 13485:2016 as the primary standard. 
In addition, based on customer requests specific participating country requirements are included in the assessment.

The MDSAP allows recognized auditing organizations to conduct a single regulatory audit of medical device manufacturers 
that satisfy the relevant requirements of the regulatory authorities participating in the program. 
Currently Canada, USA, Brazil, Japan and Australia participate in the MDSAP program.
