ABSTRACT: The longitudinal implant is fastened to bones on either side of a damaged area through a connecting device. 
Said implant is comprised of a filament or fiber composite material and said connecting device is made of a material harder than said longitudinal implant. 
The longitudinal implant is preferably made of a carbon filament composite material, wherein the filament are encapsulated in a polymer matrix. 

## Spinal fixation system and screwdriver tool for use with the same

US, Aug. 2012, [US 2012/0203288 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/89/0b/32/6b9b8d1057ea4c/US20120203288A1.pdf)

ABSTRACT: A spinal fixation system that utilizes a composite rod to which polyaxial pedicle screw/tulip assemblies are secured, 
a screwdriver that permits independent threading of a guide member to the tulip and independent threading of the pedicle screw, 
together with interengaging conical surfaces that true the screwdriver with the pedicle screw. In preferred embodiments, 
the screwdriver includes an elongated drive shaft having a handle end for imparting rotation and a pedicle screw engaging end, 
a cylindrical guide member rotatably mounted about said drive shaft, a knob at one end of said guide member for rotating same and a threaded tulip engaging end at the other end thereof. 
A grip is preferably sleeved around the cylindrical drive member and is longitudinally movable between proximal and distal positions wherein its distal end uncovers and covers, respectively, the screw engaging unit.

## Method for repair of a spine and intervertebral implant

US, Mar. 2010, [US 7,682,394 B2](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/39/56/05/a6bcc13ec1a76f/US7682394B2.pdf)

ABSTRACT: Repair of a spine from a posterior approach especially for locating an implant between a lower and upper human vertebra includes making an incision in the skin lateral to the midline, 
making an incision through the Erector Spinae Aponeurosis (ESA) following the ELIF groove, separating the ESA from the Longissimus Thoracis Pars Lumborum (LTPL), 
atraumatic separating the Multifidus from the LTPL using the interfascial boundary between the Multifidus and the LTPL, and creating a surgical plane having an angle of 20°-60°.

## Fusion implant

US, Jul. 2007, [US 7,238,206 B2](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b8/ff/74/37bcb96ab47890/US7238206.pdf)

ABSTRACT: A fusion implant apparatus, in for the replacement of a vertebra or an intervertebral disc, having at least one biocompatible structure. 
The structure is made of a composite material having reinforcing fibers, and has a first and second face to engage adjacent bone structures to be fused, 
struts extending between the first and second faces, and a hollow interior space for reception of bone growth inducing substances. 
The fibers are long fibers and the majority of these long fibers have a direction that follows the longitudinal forces upon the first and second faces, 
which is the direction of trabecular structures of the adjacent bone structure, so that a majority of long fibers are essentially an extension of these trabecular structures.

## Medical implant

US, Oct. 2007, [US 7,288,114 B2](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/42/8f/ec/b094fcf6b65021/US7288114B2.pdf)

ABSTRACT: The medical implant is constructed of a fiber reinforced plastic. That fibers (50 a, 50 b) are generally aligned in layers (C, D, E), 
wherein the fibers of at least two different layers having different orientations. The fibers are long and oriented in relationship to 
the biomechanical requirements. The implant can oppose multi-directional forces and can be manufactured with the appropriate strength and stiffness.

## Pair of lumbar interbody implants and method of fusing together adjoining vertebrae bodies

US, Sep. 2005, [US 6,942,697 B2](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a9/ce/cc/aaef98c1a042bc/US6942697.pdf)

ABSTRACT: The pair of lumbar interbody implants is designed to be pushed laterally in a space between adjacent vertebrae for replacing the disc between these vertebrae. 
Each implant comprises a first and a second saggital wall and an anterior wall at one end and a posterior wall at the other end. 
The two implants are asymmetric to each other and are therefore more appropriate for the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. 
Preferably a first implant has a first saggital wall with an outer surface that is curved and a second saggital wall that is essentially plane.

## Instrumentation for stabilizing certain vertebrae of the spine

US , Sep. 2004, [US 6,786,907 B2](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/13/8d/63/daae01a875bdc3/US6786907.pdf)

a connector (6) having an opening (7) therethrough, a mechanism (10) is adapted to affix said bone-anchoring element (2) in the opening (7); 
the connector (6) has a hook portion (11) adapted to cooperate with a support (32) of the bone-anchoring element (2) for clamping the longitudinal element (1); 
the hook portion (11) has at its bottom side a recess (12) for receiving the longitudinal element (1); the longitudinal element (1) is clamped against said support (32), 
so that the force of the support (32) on the longitudinal element (1) is approximately parallel to the axis (D) of the bone-anchoring element (2).
