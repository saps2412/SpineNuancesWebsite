<!--more-->

<!-- Preoperative instructions to the patient are essential. The patient should be made aware of the limitations of the implant and potential adverse effects of the surgery. 
The patient should be instructed to limit postoperative activities as this will reduce the risk of bent, broken or loose implants. 
The patient must be made aware that implants may bend, break or loosen even though restrictions in activity are followed.
Postoperative evaluation of the fusion and implant status is necessary. After the fusion, implant does not have to be removed. -->
