The ostaPek速 carbon composite material is radiolucent and therefore allows for clear post-operative radiological visual assessment and treatment.

67% of the ostaPek速 carbon composite material are long, oriented carbon fibers embedded in a 33% PEKEKK matrix.

PEKEKK has a noticeably higher strength level and overall stability compared to PEEK.
