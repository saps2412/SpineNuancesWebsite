The ostaPek® carbon composite material is radiolucent and therefore allows for clear post-operative radiological visual assessment and treatment.

67% of the ostaPek® carbon composite material are long, oriented carbon fibers embedded in a 33% PeKeKK matrix.

PeKeKK, a part of the PAEK family of polymers, has a noticeably higher strength level and overall loading capacity compared to PEEK.
