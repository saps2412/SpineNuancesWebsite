[ostaPek®](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) carbon composite cages and plates meet the mechanical requirements to ensure primary stability and strength throughout the bone fusion mass development. 

At the same time, the stiffness of ostaPek® constructs is designed to provide an active stimulation of the bone cells during the development of the bone fusion mass.
