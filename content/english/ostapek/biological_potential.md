Compared to PEEK carbon composite implants show 4 times more cell growth. Human osseous cells are distributed homogeneously on the carbon composite implant surfaces compared to multi-layered discontinuous cell clusters on PEEK.

Moreover, even in comparison to Titanium surfaces carbon composite implants show improved results in terms of cellular density and viability.
