[Carbon composite](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) spine implants show five times more cell growth compared to PEEK [[Barbanti Brodano, 2007](https://saps2412.github.io/publications/Composite%20Barbanti%20Brodano%202007.pdf)]. 
Human osseous cells are distributed continuously and homogeneously on the carbon composite implant surfaces compared to multi-layered discontinuous cell clusters on PEEK.

Moreover, even in comparison to titanium surfaces [carbon composite](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) 
implants show significantly improved results in terms of cellular density, viability and osseointegration [[Sigot-Luizard, 2000](https://saps2412.github.io/publications/Composite%20Sigot%20Luizard%202000.pdf) and [Petersen, 2016](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6439/4/1/1)].
