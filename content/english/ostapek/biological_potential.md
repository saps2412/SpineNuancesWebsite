Carbon composite implants show five times more cell growth compared to PEEK [Barbanti Brodano, 2007]. 
Human osseous cells are distributed continuously and homogeneously on the carbon composite implant surfaces compared to multi-layered discontinuous cell clusters on PEEK.

Moreover, even in comparison to titanium surfaces carbon composite implants show improved results in terms of cellular density and viability [Sigod-Luizard, 2000].
