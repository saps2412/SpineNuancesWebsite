ostaPek速 anterior lumbar interbody fusion cages.

The ALIF cages are designed for the classical anterior lumbar discectomy and fusion surgery. They provide full anterior support and enable recreation of the desired lumbar lordosis at the treated level.

Clinically used in Europe since 1994. Cleared by the FDA under MAX code in 2018 [510(k) K181963](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/K181963.pdf).

ALIF cages have been developed in the USA and are manufactured in Switzerland.

The ostaPek速 Interbody Fusion Cages system is indicated for use as an intervertebral body fusion device in skeletally mature patients at one or two contiguous levels of the sacro-lumbar spine (L2-S1) to facilitate fusion in case of degenerative disc disease (DDD) defined as discogenic pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history and radiographic studies. DDD patients may also have up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis at the involved level(s). 
The ostaPek Interbody Fusion Cages are placed via an anterior approach using autogenous bone graft and/or allograft comprised of cancellous and/or corticocancellous bone graft. The ostaPek Interbody Fusion Cages are to be used with supplemental fixation cleared by the FDA for use in the lumbar spine. Patients should have at least six weeks of non-operative treatment prior to surgery. Patients with previous non-fusion spinal surgery at involved level may be treated with the device.

Example of indications discogenic lombalgy of 1 or 2 levels without canal stenosis, second recidive of median disc herniation.

The ALIF cage is available in two widths, 30 mm and 35 mm, and two lengths, 20 mm and 25 mm, in multiple heights and lordosis angles.
