ostaPek® extraforaminal lumbar interbody fusion cages.

The ostaPek® erriva 3 cage is the latest design of the Coligne transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion cages. A specifically engineered interface with the cage inserter provides strength and control during implantation. Final positioning of the cage is achieved with easy-to-use instrumentation designed for this type of cage.

Clinically used in Europe since 2005. Cleared by the FDA under MAX code in 2018 [510(k) K181963](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/K181963.pdf).

ELIF cages are [patented](https://www.spinenuances.com/download/patents) and made in the USA based on Swiss technology.

The ostaPek® Interbody Fusion Cages system is indicated for use as an intervertebral body fusion device in skeletally mature patients at one or two contiguous levels of the sacro-lumbar spine (L2-S1) to facilitate fusion in case of degenerative disc disease (DDD) defined as discogenic pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history and radiographic studies. DDD patients may also have up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis at the involved level(s). The ostaPek Interbody Fusion Cages are placed via an anterior, posterior or lateral approach using autogenous bone graft and/or allograft comprised of cancellous and/or corticocancellous bone graft. The ostaPek Interbody Fusion Cages are to be used with supplemental fixation cleared by the FDA for use in the lumbar spine. Patients should have at least six weeks of non-operative treatment prior to surgery. Patients with previous non-fusion spinal surgery at involved level may be treated with the device.

Examples of indications discogenic lombalgy on 1 or 2 levels with foraminal stenosis, 2nd recidive of foraminal disc herniation.

The ELIF cage is available in two lengths with almost identical widths and 4 heights in 2 mm increments from 7 mm to 13 mm.
