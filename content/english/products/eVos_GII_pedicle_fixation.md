The GII pedicle fixation system is designed for the thoracolumbar and sacral spine with different longitudinal elements according to the specific needs of each patient. The Titanium pedicle screws used as anchors are orthogonal or poliaxial. The longitudinal elements are Titanium rods or plates in ostaPek® or Titanium. Multiple connectors and extendors are available to complement the pedicle fixation system.

Clinically used in Europe since 1996. Cleared by the FDA under codes MNH, KWP and MNI in 1998 -- 510(k) [K98082](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf/K980852.pdf), [K032604](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf3/K032604.pdf), [K051089](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf5/K051089.pdf) and [K083567](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf8/K083567.pdf).

The GII pedicle fixation is [patented](https://www.spinenuances.com/download/patents) and made in the USA based on Swiss technology.

The GII spinal fixation system when used as a pedicle screw system in the non-cervical posterior spine,  is to be used in skeletally mature patients as an adjunct to fusion using autograft and/or allograft for one or more of the following:
(1) Degenerative or severe spondylolisthesis (Grades 3 and 4) of the fifth lumbar/first sacral (L5-S1) joint with objective evidence of neurologic impairment,
(2) Fracture,
(3) Dislocation,
(4) Scoliosis,
(5) Kyphosis,
(6) Spinal tumor, and/or
(7) Failed previous fusion (pseudoarthrosis).
The GII spinal fixation system when used as a hook and sacral/iliac screw fixation system in the non- cervical posterior spine, the GII spinal fixation system is to be used in skeletally mature patients as an adjunct to fusion using autograft and/or allograft for one or more of the following:
(1) Degenerative spondylolisthesis with objective evi- dence of neurologic impairment,
(2) Fracture,
(3) Dislocation,
(4) Scoliosis,
(5) Kyphosis,
(7) Spinal tumor, and/or
(8) Failed previous fusion (pseudoarthrosis).

The GII pedicle screws are available in diameter from 4.75 mm to 8.5 mm and different length from 15 mm to 80 mm. The GII pedicle plates are available in various lengths with both slots and half-slots.
