 [ostaPek®](https://spinenuances.com/ostapek_carbon_composite) 
material has been developed in [Coligne's](http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html) bio-material lab in Boulder, Colorado.

By controling the orientation of the carbon fiber bundles, the development and production team shapes the [ostaPek®](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) carbon composite material in different configurations for optimal mechanical properties.

The expertise of the team covers the whole manufacturing process, from the polymerization of the ostaPek material, to the quality control of the finished implants in a controlled environment.
