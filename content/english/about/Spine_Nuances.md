Spine Nuances is the brainchild of a long-standing Coligne development engineer, Vittoria Brighenti. Based on the outstanding performance of [ostaPek®](https://spinenuances.com/ostapek) implants during the past 30 years in Europe, 
Spine Nuances focus is to establish the ostaPek® material as well as all [Coligne](http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html) products in the North American market as one of the leading brands 
for spine fusion. 

As Coligne's distribution arm for the North American market Spine Nuances is a complement to the Coligne business headquartered in Europe. 

We work with surgeons directly as well as agents and distributors.
