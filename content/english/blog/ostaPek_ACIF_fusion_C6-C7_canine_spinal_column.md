Jacky, a male Rottweiler age 11, suffered from tetraplegia that also restricted his mobility at the cervical spine and was associated with pain. 
MRI found a disc-protrusion with dynamic compression of the spinal cord at the C6-7 level. 
He was diagnosed with chronic progressive Caudal Cervical Spondylomyelopathy.

Jacky was treated with a 12mm x 5mm [ostaPek® ACIF/ACDF cage](https://spinenuances.com/products/acif_anterior_cervical_interbody_fusion_cage), normally used in humans. 
Additional stabilization was also performed using Compact UniLock plates. The surgeon harvested cancellous bone graft from the dog’s humeral head. 
This was placed inside the ostaPek® cage and anterior to the plate. Jacky recovered completely. 

At 6 and 12 months, post-op x-ray images show progressive bony fusion growing through the [ostaPek®](https://spinenuances.com/ostapek) cage. 
Two years after surgery, Jacky was diagnosed with an aggressive bone tumor in one pelvic limb. He underwent euthanasia and his owner allowed this study.

The specimen shows that living bone spans through the ostaPek® cage in complete ossification, linking the C6-C7 vertebrae of the cervical spine.

## ostaPek® ACIF/ACDF cervical interbody fusion

ostaPek® ACIF/ACDF implants are made of [ostaPek® carbon composite](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) which is [intrinsically osteophilic](https://spinenuances.com/blog/ostapek_carbon_composite_part_one_biology), 
no coatings required and its mechanical properties are tailored to ensure primary stability and promote remodeling.

The thin wall cage design enables unparalleled graft to cage volume ratio and the open three-strut cage architecgture matches vertebral endplates and lowers the risk of subsidence whilst
the large lateral and transverse bone ports allow for optimal fusion.

The ostaPek® ACIF/ACDF is available in a number of sizes to provide ease of use, flat or domed, lots of space for graft and optimal match of intervertebral space. 
Just select the right sized trial, verify the fit and then place the ACIF/ACDF cage filled with the medium of choice. 

Gold-markers confirm the implant position and the material is fully radiolucent for high quality diagnostic follow up with CT, MRI and plane x-ray.
