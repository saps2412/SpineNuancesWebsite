Pre-op images illustrate the case of a polytraumatized 19-year-old woman involved in a motor vehicle accident, diagnosed with a one-level (C7) burst fracture. The backward movement of the posterior wall of C7 lead to a decrease in muscular tonus in the upper limbs.

Patient was treated with a 17.2mm [Trabis™ Cervical Corpectomy](https://spinenuances.com/products/trabis_cervical_corpectomy_vertebral_body_replacement_cage) cage made of [ostaPek® carbon composite](https://spinenuances.com/ostapek).

Post-op images (7 days after surgery) show good root canal release, cage/graft area matches vertebral endplates well and lowers the risk of subsidence. The posterior wall alignment of C7 is restore in a satisfactory way. The domed shape of the upper part of the implant is optimally congruent with the lower part of C6. Complete disappearance of motoric disorders.

## Trabis™ cervical corpectomy cages

Trabis™ implants are made of [ostaPek® carbon composite](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) which is [intrinsically osteophilic](https://spinenuances.com/blog/ostapek_carbon_composite_part_one_biology/), 
no coatings required and its mechanical properties are tailored to ensure primary stability and promote remodeling.

The thin wall cage design enables unparalleled graft to cage volume ratio and the open three-strut cage design matches vertebral endplates and lowers the risk of subsidence whilst
the large lateral, sagittal and transverse bone ports allow for optimal fusion.

The Trabis™ is available in a number of sizes to provide ease of use and match the endplate curvature. Just select the right sized trial, verify
the fit and then place the Trabis™ cage filled with the medium of choice. 


Gold-markers confirm the implant position and the material is fully radiolucent for high quality diagnostic follow up with CT, MRI and plane x-ray.
