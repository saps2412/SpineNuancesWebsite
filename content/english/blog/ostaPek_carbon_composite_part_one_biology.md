ostaPek® is the [carbon composite material](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) developed and made by [Coligne](http://www.coligne.com/international/home.html) 
for spine fusion applications, since 1994. It is made of 67% long oriented carbon fibers embedded in a 33% PEKEKK matrix. 

When thinking of potential advantages of ostaPek® carbon composite compared to state-of-the-art materials for spinal fusion, such as PEEK or metals, 
there are at least 3 major fields where ostaPek® can have an impact: biology, biomechanics, and response to radiation.

Let's start with biology. ostaPek® bio-compatibility has been carefully assessed prior to release to market by in vitro and in vivo studies. 
It is also continuously monitored according to the regulatory requirements of [ISO 10993](https://www.iso.org/standard/68936.html). 
More than 100’000 patients treated with ostaPek® implants over 25 years in Europe and the United States show the safety of the biomaterial. 
Bio-compatibility is an absolute requirement for medical implants, but what else can ostaPek® bring? 

In 2007, a study performed at [Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli](http://www.ior.it/en/curarsi-al-rizzoli), Bologna, Italy 
described a rate of cell growth 5 times higher in carbon composite material compared to PEEK [[Barbanti Brodano, 2007](https://saps2412.github.io/publications/Composite%20Barbanti%20Brodano%202007.pdf)], 
and a continuous and homogeneous distribution of human osseous cells on the carbon composite implant surfaces compared to multi-layered discontinuous cell clusters on PEEK.

In comparison to titanium surfaces, ostaPek® implants show improved results in terms of cellular density and viability of human osseous cells, 
without needing a coating [[Sigot-Luizard, 2000](https://saps2412.github.io/publications/Composite%20Sigot%20Luizard%202000.pdf)]. 

Moreover, [[Petersen, 2016](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6439/4/1/1)] showed that osseointegration in terms of percent bone area for distances from the implant surface of 0.1mm was four times higher for carbon-fiber-reinforced composite compared to Titanium.

Switching from the material surface to the actual implants, “more space for bone” is a key design principle for the [ostaPek® intervertebral cages](https://spinenuances.com/products). 
Thin walls and a light architecture allow for a large volume of bone graft within the cage and a maximized surface of graft in contact with the end plates.

With the awareness that a successful spinal procedure is the result of multiple factors, we have designed the [ostaPek® material](https://saps2412.github.io/sales_mktg/what_is_ostaPek_and_why.pdf) and implants to optimize the fusion process, 
bringing a new level of function, security, and physiological satisfaction to the patients.
